# This file contains the implementation of the ms-outdec
# algorithm, which is a magnitude and shape outlier detector.
# The shape component is based on the CCR-periodogram proposed
# by Lopez-Oriona 2021, and the magnitude component is obtained
# with a weak multivariate version of the Fraiman-Mu√±iz depth.
