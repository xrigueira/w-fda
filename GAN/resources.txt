I have been able to find several implementations of TimeGAN

    1. The original method was proposed by Jinsung Yoon at NIPS in 2019: https://papers.nips.cc/paper/2019/file/c9efe5f26cd17ba6216bbe2a7d26d490-Paper.pdf
    The paper includes the source code: https://bitbucket.org/mvdschaar/mlforhealthlabpub/src/master/alg/timegan/ The main problem is that it is in tensorflow 1.10.0
    which is compatible with Python 3.6, 3.5, and 3.4. but I need to use Python >= 3.8 due to the requirements by scikit-fda.
    
    2. The company YData adapted their methods to tensorflow 2. The person in charge, Fabiana Clemente, did a post on Towards Data Science: https://towardsdatascience.com/synthetic-time-series-data-a-gan-approach-869a984f2239
    And the company's repo on Github contains the source code: https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic/tree/dev/src/ydata_synthetic/synthesizers/timeseries/timegan
    The problem with this implementation is that when I installed it gave me a lot of compatibility errors.
    
    3. Stefan Jansen: Wrote a book on machine learning for trading, which includes the source code on Github: https://github.com/stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading. This comes with a tensorflow 2 implementation
    located at: https://github.com/stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading/tree/main/21_gans_for_synthetic_time_series and the data can be downloaded following: https://github.com/stefan-jansen/machine-learning-for-trading/blob/main/data/create_datasets.ipynb
    The data used in the example is the first one: Quandl Wiki Prices.
    
    4. Flavia Giammarino also posted a tensorflow 2 implementation on GitHub: https://github.com/flaviagiammarino/time-gan-tensorflow
